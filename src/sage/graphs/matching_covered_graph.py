Matching covered graphs

This module implements functions and operations pertaining to matching covered
graphs.

A *matching* in a graph is a set of pairwise nonadjacent links
(nonloop edges). In other words, a matching in a graph is the edge set of an
1-regular subgraph. A matching is called a *perfect* *matching* if it the
subgraph generated by a set of matching edges spans the graph, i.e. it's the
edge set of an 1-regular spanning subgraph. A connected nontrivial graph is
called *matching* *covered* if each edge participates in some perfect matching.

class MatchingCoveredGraph(Graph):
    r"""
    Matching covered graph

    INPUT:

    - ``data`` -- can be any of the following:

      - Empty or ``None`` (throws a :exc:`ValueError` as the graph must be
        nontrival).

      - An arbitrary graph.

    - ``matching`` -- (default: ``None``); a perfect matching of the
      graph, that can be given using any valid input format of
      :class:`~sage.graphs.graph.Graph`.

      If set to ``None``, a matching is computed using the other parameters.

    - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``'Edmonds'``); the algorithm to be
      used to compute a maximum matching of the graph among

      - ``'Edmonds'`` selects Edmonds' algorithm as implemented in NetworkX,

      - ``'LP'`` uses a Linear Program formulation of the matching problem.

    - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed Integer
      Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the
      default one is used. For more information on MILP solvers and which
      default solver is used, see the method :meth:`solve
      <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
      :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
      <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

    - ``verbose`` -- integer (default: ``0``); sets the level of verbosity:
      set to 0 by default, which means quiet (only useful when ``algorithm
      == 'LP'``).

    - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP
      solvers over an inexact base ring; see
      :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.

    OUTPUT:

    - An object of the class :class:`~MatchingCoveredGraph` if the input is
      valid and the graph is matching covered, or otherwise an error is thrown.

    .. NOTE::

        All remaining arguments are passed to the ``Graph`` constructor
